Greetings, earthling! I'm Luka Hadži-Đokić and I've been programmed to like programming language theory. I'm a student at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade. You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hgluka) and [github](https://github.com/hgluka) and also [right here](#). Or you can read my [CV](resume.pdf). I might write in Serbian occasionally.
